## Bike Sharing Assignment

### Introduction
we need to build a multi linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes.

### Problem Statement 

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.


### Business Goal:
We need build the model for the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 

# Conclusion:

Train R-squire=0.844

Test R-squire=0.7795

Train Adj-R-squire=0.841

Test Adj-R-squire=0.832

That seems a very good model.
